# Next.js router.push Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `router.push` method in Next.js: unexpected behavior where the page doesn't redirect, and there are no error messages in the console. This can be frustrating because debugging becomes harder without any errors to look into. 

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, whereas `bugSolution.js` presents a potential solution to resolve the issue. The solution is focused on error handling and ensuring the correct usage of the `router.push` method, which involves various factors including proper event handling, asynchronous operations, and potential issues with the Next.js application setup.
